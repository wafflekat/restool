# Hafen Restool
Command line tool to parse a Hafen res file.
Currently only extracts images and saves them as pngs.

May require Python 3.9 (haven't tested on lower versions)

# Usage

### Install requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run
`python main.py OPTION`

Where OPTION is one of the following:

* `-f filepath`   Path to the res file on your computer
* `-u respath`    Res path i.e. gfx/terobjs/mm/thingwall
